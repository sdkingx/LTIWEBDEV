    [Intro]
    He-he-here we go!
    
    So they're finally here, performing for you
    If you know the words, you can join in too
    Put your hands together, if you want to clap
    As we take you through this monkey rap!
    Huh!
    
    [Chorus]
    DK
    Donkey Kong!
    
    [Verse 1]
    He's the leader of the bunch, you know him well
    He's finally back to kick some tail
    His coconut gun can fire in spurts
    If he shoots ya, it's gonna hurt!
    He's bigger, faster, and stronger too
    He's the first member of the DK crew!
    Huh!
    
    [Chorus]
    DK
    Donkey Kong!
    DK
    Donkey Kong is here!
    
    [Verse 2]
    This Kong's got style, so listen up dudes
    She can shrink in size, to suit her mood
    She's quick and nimble when she needs to be
    She can float through the air and climb up trees!
    If you choose her, you'll not choose wrong
    With a skip and a hop, she's one cool Kong!
    Huh!
    
    [Chorus]
    DK
    Donkey Kong!
    
    [Verse 3]
    He has no style, he has no grace
    Th-this Kong has a funny face
    He can handstand when he needs to
    And stretch his arms out, just for you
    Inflate himself just like a balloon
    This crazy Kong just digs this tune!
    Huh!
    
    [Chorus]
    DK
    Donkey Kong!
    DK
    Donkey Kong is here!
    
    [Verse 4]
    He's back again and about time too
    And this time he's in the mood
    He can fly real high with his jetpack on
    With his pistols out, he's one tough Kong!
    He'll make you smile when he plays his tune
    But Kremlings beware 'cause he's after you!
    Huh!
    
    [Chorus]
    DK
    Donkey Kong!
    Huh!
    
    [Verse 5]
    Finally, he's here for you
    It's the last member of the DK crew!
    This Kong's so strong, it isn't funny
    Can make a Kremling cry out for mummy
    Can pick up a boulder with relative ease
    Makes crushing rocks seem such a breeze
    He may move slow, he can't jump high
    But this Kong's one hell of a guy!
    
    [Skit]
    C'mon Cranky, take it to the fridge!
    
    [Outro]
    Walnuts, peanuts, pineapple smells
    Grapes, melons, oranges and coconut shells
    Aww yeah!
    Walnuts, peanuts, pineapple smells
    Grapes, melons, oranges and coconut shells
    Aww yeah!
